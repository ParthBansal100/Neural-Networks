# Neural-Networks
The purpose of this assignment was to get familiar with the concept of neural networks and
libraries like Pytorch to implement them.
I tried to train different CNN models to classify set of hand-written digits from the MNIST
dataset and images from the CIFAR dataset.
I also tried to implement GANs to generate new anime faces from a random input.
